# Volume by Carrier

The **Volume by Carrier** report enables you to see a breakdown of how many consignments and packages you have shipped with each of your carriers, what percentage of your total consignments each carrier represents, and how the volume of consignments shipped with each carrier has changed over time. It comprises a table listing consignment and packages data, a **Consignments by Carrier** pie chart showing each carrier's share of your consignments, and **Consignments Shipped by Carrier Over Time** line graph.
