# Traffic Profile

The **Traffic Profile** report shows how many consignments that your organisation has manifested in a given timeframe, and the weights of the consignments manifested. It comprises a table listing consignment and packages data, and two bar charts: **Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight** and **Consignment Volume Distribution by Volumetric Weight**.

> In the context of PRO, the term "consignment" refers to a collection of one or more packages that are shipped from the same origin address, to the same destination address, on behalf of the same Sorted customer, using the same carrier service, on the same day.
>
> A package is an item or a collection of items, wrapped or contained together for shipment. Each package can contain one or more items.
>
> As an example, suppose that a clothing retailer has received a customer order for a necklace, a bracelet, a coat, and a hat. As the necklace and bracelet are both physically small, the retailer elects to ship them in the same package. As such, this sales order would break down to:
>
> * Four items - The necklace, the bracelet, the coat, and the hat.
> * Three packages - One containing the necklace and bracelet, one containing the coat, and one containing the hat.
> * A single consignment corresponding to everything on the order.

</a>

The consignment data table visual lists the following information for each carrier (with any report filters taken into account):

* **Consignments** - Number of consignments manifested.
* **Packages** - Number of packages manifested.
* **Average Packages Per Consignment**
* **Average Weight, KG** - The average weight, in kilograms, of the consignments shipped.
* **Average Weight, Volumetric** - The average volumetric weight of the consignments shipped.

### Visual Filters

## Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight Chart

The **Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight** chart displays the weight distribution of your manifested consignments.

</a>

In the example above, the company in question has shipped 53,324 consignments that were between 0 and 4.75kg in weight, 10,306 parcels that were between 4.76 and 9.52 kg in weight, and so on.

## Consignment Volume Distribution by Volumetric Weight Chart

The **Consignment Volume Distribution by Volumetric Weight** chart displays the volumetric weight distribution of your manifested consignments.

>
> Volumetric weight is a method of estimating a parcel's weight using its dimensions. It is usually calculated as the parcel's length x weight x height (all in cm) / 5000, although exact calculations can vary between carriers.
> 
> For example, a 10cm cube would have a volumetric weight of 10 x 10 x 10 / 5000 = 0.2 kg

In the example above, the company in question has shipped 65,091 consignments that were between 0 and 9.26kg in volumetric weight, 7,550 parcels that were between 9.72 and 18.53 kg in volumetric weight, and so on.
