SortedPRO carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services that can be used in the allocation process. To allocate a consignment to the cheapest available carrier service in a particular carrier service group, use the **[Allocate Consignment With Service Group](https://docs.electioapp.com/#/api/AllocateConsignmentWithServiceGroup)** endpoint.  

> <span class="note-header">Note:</span>
> Carrier service groups are designed to help you allocate your consignments to the best possible service. For example, you might set up a group containing all services that will ship dangerous goods. You would then allocate within that group for all consignments involving dangerous items. 
>
> To configure carrier service groups, use the <strong><a href="https://www.electioapp.com/Configuration/CarrierServiceGroups">Configuration - Carrier Service Groups</a></strong> UI page. 

The **Allocate Consignment With Service Group** endpoint takes the `{consignmentReference}` of the consignment you want to allocate and the `{mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference}` of the service group you want to allocate from as path parameters, and returns an Allocation Summary with details of the service that was allocated. 

The `{mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference}` is a unique identifier for each carrier service group. To find the `{mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference}` for a particular group, log in to the PRO UI, navigate to the **[Configuration - Carrier Service Groups](https://www.electioapp.com/Configuration/CarrierServiceGroups)** page, and locate the tile for that group. The `{mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference}` is shown in the **Code** field.
