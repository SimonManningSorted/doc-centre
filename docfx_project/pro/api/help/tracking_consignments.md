# Tracking Consignments

PRO's Tracking API enables you to drive embedded delivery tracking from your own website, without the need to pass customers off to a carrier portal. This page explains how to use the Tracking API to get updates on a consignment's progress.

## Tracking API Overview

PRO's Tracking API has three endpoints:

* **Get Tracking Events** - Returns full tracking event information for a specific consignment, including separate details for each leg of a shipment.
* **Get Events Per Package** - Returns flattened tracking event information for a specific consignment, broken down by package. Does not take multiple legs into account.
* **Post Tracking Events** - Enables carriers to post events directly to PRO.
