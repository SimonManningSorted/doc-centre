# Selecting Options

Once the customer has selected an  pickup or delivery option, you'll need to record their choice in SortedPRO via the **Select Option** endpoint. To make a **Select Option** request, send a `POST` request to `https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions/select/{deliveryOptionReference}`.

Once it has received the selected `{deliveryOptionReference}`, PRO has all the information it needs to create and allocate a consignment. The consignment details were passed as part of the original request to get delivery options, and the `{deliveryOptionReference}` passed to the **Select Option** endpoint confirms the required delivery promise.

PRO creates and allocates a consignment with the selected details, and returns links to the consignment resource that was allocated, a summary of the carrier service that the consignment was allocated to, a link to the relevant package labels, and a `ConsignmentLegs` array indicating how many legs the shipment will need. Where a shipment would need multiple legs to complete, the `ConsignmentLegs` array shows tracking details for each individual leg.

### Select Option Example

The example shows a request to select a delivery option that has a `{deliveryOptionReference}` of _EDO-000-6DX-6XP_. PRO creates a consignment with a `{consignmentReference}` of _EC-000-05B-MMQ_, which it then  allocates to the carrier service associated with delivery option _EDO-000-6DX-6XP_. PRO then returns the relevant `{consignmentReference}` and label link, enabling you to get labels for and manifest the consignment.

</div>     

Once the customer has selected an available delivery option, you'll need to record their choice in SortedPRO via the **[Select Delivery Option as an Order](https://docs.electioapp.com/#/api/SelectDeliveryOptionasanOrder)** endpoint. This endpoint takes the `{Reference}` of the selected option as a path parameter.

Once it has received the **Select Delivery Option as an Order** request, PRO uses the details of the selected option to create an order and returns an object containing the associated `{orderReference}`. The reference will come in useful in the next step, when we pack the order into consignments.

### Select Option As Order Example

The example shows a request to select a delivery option that has a `{Reference}` of _EDO-000-6DX-6XP_ as an order. PRO takes that delivery option's details and creates an order with an `{orderReference}` of _EO-000-002-0TT_.
